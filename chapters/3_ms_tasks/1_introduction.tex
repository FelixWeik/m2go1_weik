\subsubsection*{Architectural Style}
The Unified Microservice Engineering approach aligns with the microservices architectural style.
This involves breaking down an application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately.
The services communicate with each other through APIs and are usually organized around business capabilities.
These services aim to enhance flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.

Predecessors of the microservices architectural style are the service-oriented architecture (SOA) and the distributed systems architectural style which will be further explained in the following.

\paragraph*{Service Oriented Architecture}
SOA shares some similarities with the microservices architectural style.
The focus is on organizing services around business capabilities and developing them independently.
This aims to achieve reusability and interoperability.

Yet, microservices tend to be generally smaller, more fine-grained, decoupled and are usually lightweight.

\paragraph*{Distributed Systems}
Distributed systems represent a collection of independent computers, appearing to the users of the system as a single coherent system.
These systems handle tasks across a network, each node having its local memory and set of responsibilities.

Microservices share a similar idea: Splitting an application into smaller, more independent services communicating with each other.
Each microservice manages its functionalities and data to provide the overall functionality of the application.
