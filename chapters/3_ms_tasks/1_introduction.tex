\subsubsection*{Architectural Style}
The Unified Microservice Engineering approach aligns with the microservices architectural style.
This involves breaking down an application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately.
The services communicate with each other through APIs and are usually organized around business capabilities.
These services aim to enhance flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.

Predecessors of the microservices architectural style are the service-oriented architecture (SOA) and the distributed systems architectural style that will be further explained in the following.

\paragraph*{Service Oriented Architecture}
SOA shares some similarities with the microservices architectural style.
The focus is on organizing services around business capabilities and developing them independently.
This aims to achieve reusability and interoperability.
