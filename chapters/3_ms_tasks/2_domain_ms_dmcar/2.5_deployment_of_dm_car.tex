\subsection{Excercise DockerEnvironmentSetup}
This exercise is about setting up the Docker environment.
//TODO Finish introduction
\subsubsection*{Installing Docker}
The installation is carried out on the author's machine running Windows 11 with WSL2.
The installation is done by following the official Docker documentation \cite{DO-INST} and the provided guide on the task sheet \cite{CM-G-BSD}.

After successfully installing Docker, the installation is verified by running \texttt{docker --version} and \texttt{docker-compose --version} in the terminal.
The output of the commands is shown in \autoref*{fig:docker_installation_verification}.

\subsubsection*{Running Hello-World Container}
The next step is to run the Hello-World container.
This is done by running the \texttt{docker run hello-world} command in the terminal.
The command is executed twice showing the differences between both executions.

Execution one is shown in \autoref*{fig:docker_hello_world_first_execution}.
The output shows that the image needed for the container is not available locally at first.
Therefore, the image is pulled automatically from the Docker Hub.
Afterwards, the container is started and the output is shown.

The second execution is shown in \autoref*{fig:docker_hello_world_second_execution}.
Here, the image is already available locally and therefore, no new image needs to be pulled from the Docker Hub.
The container is started instantly and the same output is shown.
