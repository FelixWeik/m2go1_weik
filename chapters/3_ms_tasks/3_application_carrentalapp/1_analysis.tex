\subsubsection*{Requirements Analysis of CarRentalCLI}
Taking a closer look at the functions of RentalManagementV1.0, the functions of the CarRentalCLI can be spotted.
\texttt{rentCar}, and \texttt{cancelRental} have already been implemented in CarRentalCLI.
To implement these functions correctly the OCL constraints used to analyze the CarRentalCLI can be reused.
Therefore the use cases for \texttt{rentCar} and \texttt{cancelRental} can be reused as well.
Also the \texttt{car} model, although using the domain entity \texttt{Car} from the domain microservice, is the same model as described in CarRentalCLI's requirements analysis.

\subsubsection*{Terms Used V1.0}
A type-name pair is used to describe the terms used in the requirements analysis.
Each type-name pair is described in a table, in this case, it is the table \texttt{Terms Used V1.0} from the \texttt{0.DocCarRentalAppV1} repository found at \url{https://gitlab.kit.edu/kit/cm/teaching/carrentalapp/0.doccarrentalappv1}.
