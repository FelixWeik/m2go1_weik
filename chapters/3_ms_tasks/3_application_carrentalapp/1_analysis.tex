\subsubsection*{Requirements Analysis of CarRentalCLI}
Taking a closer look at the functions of RentalManagementV1.0, the functions of the CarRentalCLI can be spotted.
\texttt{rentCar}, and \texttt{cancelRental} have already been implemented in CarRentalCLI.
To implement these functions correctly the OCL constraints used to analyze the CarRentalCLI can be reused.
Therefore the use cases for \texttt{rentCar} and \texttt{cancelRental} can be reused as well.
Also the \texttt{car} model, although using the domain entity \texttt{Car} from the domain microservice, is the same model as described in CarRentalCLI's requirements analysis.
