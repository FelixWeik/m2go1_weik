\subsection{Excercise API Controller}
\subsubsection*{Differences in the Micro Architecture}
% Explain Differences in Files between gRPC and ReST
Several differences appear in the file structure of the gRPC and ReST APIs.
First, differences in the subfolders appear.
The gRPC API has two subfolders, namely \texttt{pb} and \texttt{mappers}.
The ReST API has none of these, all files are located in the \texttt{controllers} folder.
Next, there are differences in the provided controller files.
While the ReST implementation has only one controller, the gRPC implementation has three namely the \texttt{CustomerController}, the \texttt{CustomersCollectionController}, and the \texttt{RentalsCollectionController}.
Next, the gRPC implementation has additional mappers.
Both implementations provide mappers in the \texttt{infrastructure} package mapping between persistency entities and models, yet the gRPC implementation provides additional mappers in the \texttt{controller} package mapping between serialized protobuf data and the models.
The gRPC implementation has the \texttt{pb} subfolder containing generated code from the specification.
It holds the primitives to interact with the API that are located in the generated code of the ReST implementation.
Also, the generated files of the ReST implementation are much shorter than in the gRPC implementation.

\subsubsection*{Interfaces Implementation}
% Which interfaces are implemented by CustomerController and RentalsCollectionController

% How do the interfaces relate to the protobuf specification

% Why does the CustomerController contain the entry pb.UnimplmentedCustomerServiceServer

\subsubsection*{Mappers}
% Why are there mappers between the API controller and the logic

% Which data is transformed
